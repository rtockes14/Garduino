# Garduino(I know I'm using an esp32 now -- this started on an uno)
 This is the hardware-side of 'Blue Garden', which is a larger project in another respository currently private due to my need to update .gitignores for envs and such.

Blue Garden is a web app hosted on Heroku, coded using Python/Flask. 

The ESP32/hardware side has a screen that submits sensor readings via POST request to my api and stores readings in a postgres db.  

I'm a hobbiest so please understand.  I know the code is attrocious.
